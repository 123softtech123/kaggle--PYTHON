#hint
7--3 is 10. To match how Python evaluates this expression, we would parenthesize it as 7-(-3). The first - is treated as a subtraction operator, but the second one is treated as negation. We're subtracting negative 3 (which is equivalent to adding 3). Subsequent -s are all treated as additional negations, so they cause the subtracted quantity to flip back and forth between 3 and negative 3. Therefore, when there are an odd number of -s, the expression equals 4. When there's an even number, the expression equals 10.
